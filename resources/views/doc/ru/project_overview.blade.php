                <h3 class="mb-4">What to do after purchase?</h3>
                <h6>1. Check theme inside out</h6>
                <p>After extracting .zip file, check every file and folder to know more about theme inside out. Confused with any file/folder usage? Check <a href="#directory" class="text-dark"><u>above directory</u></a> structure to clear your doubts. We recommended reading the whole documentation for better understanding of theme. Yes, it will take up to 30 mins but it will be worth reading.</p>

                <h6>2. Install local environment for customization (Optional but highly recommended)</h6>
                <p>Go to <a href="gulp.html">Gulp section</a> and follow the steps. You can skip this step if you prefer to work with Eduport as a static source without Gulp and Sass.</p>

                <h6>3. Branding</h6>
                <p>After installation and running gulp, change your brand colors buy following <a href="color-scheme.html">Color scheme section</a> instructions. Change your brand logo by following <a href="logo-settings.html">Logo settings section</a></p>

                <h6>4. Customization</h6>
                <p>Now you can start customizing your website as per your need. </p>

                <h6>5. Delete unnecessary file and folder to upload on live server</h6>
                <p>After completing your website, you must need to delete unnecessary file and folder to reduce website size. Please check below folders/files usage to run your website:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mb-1"><b>assets/css:</b> You must need style.css (or style-rtl.css for RTL version). If you have not used color.css file then you can remove it.</li>
                    <li class="mb-1"><b>assets/images:</b> You can remove all unnecessary files from this folder.</li>
                    <li class="mb-1"><b>assets/js:</b> Don't delete this folder/file.</li>
                    <li class="mb-1"><b>assets/scss:</b> If you don't want sourcemap you can remove SCSS folder. You must remove source map comment from the end of the style.css (or style-rtl.css for RTL version) file to avoid warning on console log.</li>
                    <li class="mb-1"><b>assets/vendor:</b> Keep only those vendor folders that you have used in your website.</li>
                    <li class="mb-1"><b>node_modules:</b> You only need this folder for local server. Don't upload it to live server.</li>
                    <li class="mb-1"><b>docs:</b> You don't need docs folder for your live website.</li>
                </ul>
